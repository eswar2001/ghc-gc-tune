name:           ghc-gc-tune
version:        0.3.2
synopsis:       Graph performance of Haskell programs with different GC flags
description:    ghc-gc-tune runs your compiled Haskell program with different GC flags, and generates a graph of time as those GC settings vary. ghc-gc-tune lets your automate the task of finding good GC flags for your program, in order to get the best performance from it. . Graphs are rendered with gnuplot, so make sure that is installed. . Example use: .  > ghc -O2 --make binarytrees.hs > ghc-gc-tune -t svg binarytrees 12 . Example output: . <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Ghc-gc-tune> . For more information on GHC garbage collector settings, see <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/runtime-control.html#rts-options-gc> .
